          Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides a
          high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of the intended
          transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets the transaction
          context based on the consumer's location and action on their UI. But
          sometimes, during unsolicited callbacks, the BPP also sets the
          transaction context but it is usually the same as the context of a
          previous full-cycle, request-callback interaction between the BAP and
          the BPP. The context object contains four types of fields.
          <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using fields
          like `domain`, `country`, and `region`.</li><li>Addressing details
          like the sending and receiving platform's ID and API
          URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol version
          that implemented by the sender and,</li><li>Transaction details like
          the method being called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id
          that represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message ID to
          pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture sending times, a
          ttl to specifiy the validity of the request, and a key to encrypt
          information if necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in
          every interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S implementations,
          it is not necessary to send the context during the synchronous
          response. However, in asynchronous protocols, the context must be sent
          during all interactions,

              This is a unique value which persists during a request / callback
              cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are asynchronous, BAPs need a
              common value to match an incoming callback from a BPP to an
              earlier call. This value can also be used to ignore duplicate
              messages coming from the BPP. It is recommended to generate a
              fresh message_id for every new interaction. When sending
              unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new message_id.

                                      group. This property can be set by BAPs
                                      during search to narrow the `search` and
                                      achieve more relevant results. When
                                      received during `on_search`, BAPs must
                                      render this list under the heading
                                      described by the `name` property of this
                                      schema.

                                        Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                        extended metadata. This object can be
                                        added as a property to any schema to
                                        describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                        tags can be sent during search to
                                        optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                        can use tags to index their catalog to
                                        allow better search functionality. Tags
                                        are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                        catalog response in the `on_search`
                                        callback. Tags are also meant for
                                        display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                        BAPs are meant to render them as
                                        name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                        useful when rendering tabular
                                        information about a product or service.

                        Describes the direct performer, driver or executor that
                        fulfills an order. It is usually a person. But in some
                        rare cases, it could be a non-living entity like a
                        drone, or a bot. Some examples of agents are Doctor in
                        the healthcare sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                        or a delivery person in the logistics sector. This
                        object can be set at any stage of the order lifecycle.
                        This can be set at the discovery stage when the BPP
                        wants to provide details on the agent fulfilling the
                        order, like in healthcare, where the doctor's name
                        appears during search. This object can also used to
                        search for a particular person that the customer wants
                        fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this object gets
                        instantiated after the order is confirmed, like in the
                        case of on-demand taxis, where the driver is assigned
                        after the user confirms the ride.

                settlement should happen, and</li><li>A transaction reference
                ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the BPP reserves the right
                to decide the terms of payment. However, the BAP can send its
                terms to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to those
                terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the BAP.
                If overridden, the BAP must either agree to the terms sent by
                the BPP in order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort
                the transaction. In case of such disagreements, the BAP and the
                BPP can perform offline negotiations on the payment terms. Once
                an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP can resume
                transactions.

                                a Form Input. Sometimes, selection of catalog
                                elements is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                order. For example, to confirm a flight ticket,
                                the airline requires details of the passengers
                                along with information on baggage, identity, in
                                addition to the class of ticket. Similarly, a
                                logistics company may require details on the
                                nature of shipment in order to confirm the
                                shipping. A recruiting firm may require
                                additional details on the applicant in order to
                                confirm a job application. For all such
                                purposes, the BPP can choose to send this object
                                attached to any object in the catalog that is
                                required to be sent while placing the order.
                                This object can typically be sent at an item
                                level or at the order level. The item level
                                XInput will override the Order level XInput as
                                it indicates a special requirement of
                                information for that particular item. Hence the
                                BAP must render a separate form for the Item and
                                another form at the Order level before
                                confirmation.
